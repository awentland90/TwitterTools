Typical politician - can't make a deal work..Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!.I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!.As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!.I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!.Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut, another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!.I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!.Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!.Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!.We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!.Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!.Thank you New York, I will never forget!.A big day for New York and for our COUNTRY! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!.Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him.Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!.Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!.Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him..I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island. Big crowd, will be fun!.Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!.The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters.Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!.Leaving for Albany, New York now, massive crowd expected. Very exciting!.The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!.How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!.I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!.Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!.Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else, me, still must fight.So great to be in New York. Catching up on many things (remember, I am still running a major business while I campaign) and loving it!.It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage, Long Island!.Wisconsin, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!.A great day in Wisconsin, many stops, many great people! Melania is joining me on Monday. Big crowds. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!.Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if I win, all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!.I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!.Can you believe that Ted Cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade?.Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?.Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!.
